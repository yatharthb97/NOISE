**Note: This code is not currently compiling.**

`NOISE` is a lattice random walker simulator. The implementation allows **arbitrary** number of random walkers and dimension. The system consists of a concentric pair of hypercubes with the bigger one forming the bounding box and obeys periodic boundary conditions.  This implementation cross-compiles on an Arduino compatible microcontroller as well as a PC system. When compiled on a microcontroller, the code can be used to generate Poisson Noise signals on any available digital pin. The compiled PC system can be used as an emulator or a stand alone application.

The random walkers in the  `HyperCube` emit a `HIGH` signal, whenever a random walker passes through the smaller concentric cube. The inspiration behind this model was to crudely simulate diffusive fluorescent particles passing through a confocal volume. Outside the confocal volume (or the smaller hypercube), the signal emitted by the random walkers is `LOW`.



The file `macros.hpp` contains the macros the are used to enable/disable features and control the build environment.



â†’ For PC Systems, build using `gcc`:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o noise
```

Execute:

```bash
./noise <optional-name>
```
